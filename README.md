# Hotel-Management-System
The Hostal Carolinas is a R-DBMS project that will help to ease the check-in, 
check out, and booking process of a certain hotel. This system allows the hotel 
management to store all the Habitaciones of their hotel along with the room category and prices 
Por Dia. The Habitaciones that being stored will be used for managing the availability of the 
Habitaciones.

In Hotel Booking Management System we use PHP and MySQL Database. This project 
keeps records of booking, clients, and hotel services. Hotel Booking Management 
System has two modules i.e., admin and user.

It contains the admin section and the user (customer) section. All the editing’s, updating, 
managing Habitaciones, bookings, and payment are for the admin section. The design of this 
system is made as simple as possible so that the user won’t get any difficulties while 
working on it.
